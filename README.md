# Resident Evil: The Board Game — Campaign Tracker

An unofficial, fan-made companion app to track full campaigns of **Resident Evil: The Board Game**, built with React Native + TypeScript. Designed for players who want a fast, offline way to manage scenario progress, characters, cards, and the shared item box during play — without pausing the game to shuffle through rulebooks or spreadsheets.

## Purpose

Running a campaign of Resident Evil: The Board Game involves tracking a lot of moving state: which scenarios are unlocked, character health and inventories, kerosene, danger level, and several card piles (tension, narrative, mission, event, equipment, map, discarded). This app replaces pen-and-paper/spreadsheet tracking with a quick, mobile-friendly interface so the table can stay focused on the game.

Everything runs **100% offline** — all campaign data is stored locally on your device.

## Features

- **Campaign management** — create, edit, and delete multiple campaigns, each with its own progress
- **Scenario tracking** — locked / unlocked / completed status per scenario
- **Character management** — health track, inventory, and kerosene per character
- **Card control** — tension, narrative, mission, event, equipment, and map card piles, plus a discard pile
- **Shared Item Box & Danger Level** — manage the shared inventory and current danger level for the party
- **Campaign summary** — at-a-glance overview of overall progress
- **Light / Dark / Red themes** — runtime-switchable app theme
- **Fully offline** — no account, no network calls; all data persists locally on-device

## Tech Stack

- React Native + TypeScript (Expo)
- Gluestack UI (styled with UniWind / Tailwind CSS v4)
- Zustand + AsyncStorage for state and persistence
- React Navigation

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
